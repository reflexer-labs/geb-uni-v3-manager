## Fuzzing the Uniswap V3 manager

### Setup

The initial setup was borrowed from Uniswap V3 fuzzing, and it starts a pool with random values. Complementarily, a manager is also deployed and connected to the pool.

A few actions are allowed to be performed:

1. All pool actions inherited from uni fuzzing, which include minting, burning and swapping directly on the pool.
2. Manager actions, such as depositing, withdrawing and rebalancing.
3. Function to change redemption price and the threshold.

### First run

The following properties were tested:

1. Position Integrity, which makes sure that the manager always tracks the position it has on uniswap correctly
2. Always has a position, which ensures that the manager is always invested in the pool
3. Id Integrity, which guarantees the manager keep track of the correct id position
4. Tick selection, that means the manager is always invested in a tick range at least half of threshold
5. Supply integrity, the sum of all balances always equals the total supply.

#### Results:

#### Analysis:

All of the assertions were easily broken, but mostly due to the same issue: the market price detaching completely from the redemption price, either to a swap that crashes the price or to a direct redemption price change.

Therefore it's possible to conclude that when that happens, the manager contract itself loose it's purpose.

#### Adjustments:

-   Set initial pool parameters but close to the real world, and set the pool's initial price close to the starting redemption price
-   Bound the price changes to values closer to real world.

### Second run

After adjusting the parameters, a second round of fuzzing was run. Two more properties were added:

1. Manager contract never owns tokens, to ensure no leftover token0 or token1.
2. When the manager has an open position in the pool, it must also have a total supply greater than 0.

#### Results:
